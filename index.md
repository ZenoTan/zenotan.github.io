I am a PhD student at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), advised by [Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/). I am interested in large-scale adaptive machine learning systems. I'm currently building a distributed graph learning system called [torch_quiver](https://github.com/quiver-team/torch-quiver), and it is now open-sourced.

I graduated from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with a Bachelor degree. Previously, I interned at research labs (Microsoft Research Asia, Amazon AI) and industry (Alibaba, Tencent). I also worked as a full-time software engineer at a startup [PingCAP](https://pingcap.com/).
